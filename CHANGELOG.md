CHANGELOG for ChefSpec
======================

## 3.0.0 (TBD)
Breaking:
  - Renamed `ChefSpec::ChefRunner` to `ChefSpec::Runner` to better reflect what happens in Chef Core. Using `ChefRunner` will throw deprecation errors for now and will be removed in a future release.
  - Removed MiniTest Chef Handler examples/matchers
  - No longer load default cookbook paths:
    - vendor/cookbooks
    - test/cookbooks
    - test/integration (test kitchen)
    - spec/cookbooks
  - Resource matchers all follow the pattern "(action)_(resource_name)". ChefSpec will warn you of these deprecations in 3.0. They will be removed in 4.0. However, some resources cannot be automatically converted - **these resources will raise a deprecation exception of `ChefSpec::NoConversionError`**. The following matchers have changed:
    - `execute_command` => `run_execute`
    - `set_service_to_start_on_boot` => `enable_service`
    - `create_file_with_content` => `render_file`
    - `execute_(script)` => `run_(script)`
    - `execute_ruby_block` => `run_ruby_block`
    - `install_package_at_version` => `install_package().with(version: '')`
    - `*_python_pip` => (removed - see "Packaging Custom LWRPs in the README")
  - Remove dependency on Erubis
  - Remove dependency on MiniTest Chef Handler
  - Remove development dependency on Cucumber
  - Remove development dependency on i18n
  - Remove development dependency on simplecov
  - Separate package matchers. In prior versions of ChefSpec, the `package` matcher would match on any kind of package and any kind of package action. However, some subclasses of the package resource do not support all actions. Each package provider now has it's own matcher with only the actions it supports. Prior specs that used the generic `package` matcher will no longer match on subclasses - you must use the specific subclass matcher.
  - Separate file/cookbook_file/template matchers. In prior versions of ChefSpec, the `file` matcher would match on `file`, `cookbook_file`, and `template`. This is not ideal because it doesn't verify the correct message was sent. Now, `file`, `cookbook_file`, and `template` matchers will _only_ match resources of that type. For generic file checking, please use the new `render_file` matcher.
  - Guards are now evaluated by default. If a shell guard is executed, it must first be stubbed with the `stub_command` macro.
  - `Runner#resources` converted from an Array to a Hash. This is to ensure that all resource actions are added (when multiple calls to run_action exist (#201)). This also drastically improves resource lookup times.

Features:
  - Added a new `render_file` action to replace `create_file_with_content`. This matcher will render the contents of any file to a string and then optionally compare the result if given a `with` chainable.
  - All resources now accept a `with` chainable for matching specific resource attributes.
  - Windows attributes are now testable on non-Windows systems (like `inherits`)
  - Added `batch` resource matchers
  - Added `cookbook_file` resource matchers
  - Added `deploy` resource matchers
  - Added `erl_call` resource matchers
  - Added `git` resource matchers
  - Added `http_request` resource matchers
  - Added `ifconfig` resource matchers
  - Normalized `link` resource matchers
  - Added `log` resource matchers
  - Added `mdadm` resource matchers
  - Added `mount` resource matchers
  - Added `:immediate` and `:delayed` notification matchers
  - Added `ohai` resource matchers
  - Added `powershell_script` matchers (Chef 11.6+)
  - Added `registry_key` matchers
  - Added `remote_directory` matchers
  - Added `route` matchers
  - Added `subversion` matchers
  - Added `stub_command` macro (formerly on `ChefSpec::ChefRunner`) for stubbbing the results of shell commands. Because shell commands are evaluated by default, ChefSpec will raise an exception when encountering a shell command that has not been stubbed.
  - Added `stub_search` macro for easily stubbing `search` calls. Like shell commands, ChefSpec will raise an exception when encountering a `search` call that has not been stubbed.
  - Added `stub_data_bag` macro for easily stubbing `data_bag` calls. Like shell commands, ChefSpec will raise an exception when encountering a `data_bag` call that has not been stubbed.
  - Added `stub_data_bag_item` macro for easily stubbing` data_bag_item` calls. Like shell commands, ChefSpec will raise an exception when encountering a `data_bag_item` call that has not been stubbed.
  - Added `stub_node` helper for quickly generating a node object from Fauxhai data
  - Added `ChefSpec::Runner#apply` command to mimic the behavior of `chef-apply` (use with caution)
  - Share the `ChefSpec::Runner` object with the Node object

Improvements:
  - Move to inline documentation (Yard)
  - Implement InProcess Aruba testing for ultra-fast tests
  - Create "examples" directory for testing and demonstration
  - Unified all failure_messages_for_should
  - Use `shared_examples` for easily testing defined custom matchers
  - Infer the `cookbook_path` from the calling spec
  - Directly set node attributes with Fauxhai (formerly this was an O(n) operation)
  - Refactored ExpectExpectation to work without stubbing

    support (#37). Thanks Doug Ireton.

Bugfixes:

Features:

  - With the
    [release of Chef 10.12.0](http://www.opscode.com/blog/2012/06/19/chef-10-12-0-released/)
    the Chef versioning scheme has changed to make use of the major version
    field. The constraint on chef is now optimistic. Thanks to Robert J. Berger
    of Runa.com for flagging this issue (#28).

## 0.6.0 (May 31, 2012)

Features:

  - Service matchers extended to add support for the `:nothing` and `:enabled`
    actions. Thanks to Steve Lum (#20).

    cookbooks that expect this attribute to have been populated by OHAI. Thanks
    to Jim Hopp (#23).
  - Matchers added for the `link` resource. Thanks to James Burgess (#25).
  - Matchers added for the `remote_file` resource. Thanks to Matt Pruitt (#26).

## 0.4.0 (November 14, 2011)

Features:

  - Ruby 1.9.3 is now supported.
  - The `create_file_with_content` matcher now matches on partial content (#13). This is an API behaviour change but
  sufficiently minor and unlikely to break existing specs that I'm not bumping the major version. Thanks Chris Griego
  and Morgan Nelson from getaroom.

Bugfixes:

  - Fixed a bug in the `install_package_at_version` matcher where it would error if the package action was not
  explicitly specified (#13). Thanks Chris Griego and Morgan Nelson from getaroom.

## 0.3.0 (October 2, 2011)
